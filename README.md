# Shady Ali
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a highly motivated Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities (expected graduation: June 2026) and Egypt University of Informatics (expected graduation: June 2026), with a passion for AI Research, Mathematics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Software Engineering.  I have a strong academic record (GPA: 4.0 at UMN, 3.9 at EUI) and a proven track record of applying my skills to real-world problems.  I'm enthusiastic about contributing to innovative projects and collaborating with other developers.

## Whats New

*  I recently made my first ever open-source contribution for CrewAI-Tools. Checkout the [Pull Request](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/237).  
*  I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Euclid Solutions, building agentic and ML-based solutions for businesses.  

## About Me

I'm a quick learner with experience in developing and deploying machine learning models, building scalable applications, and conducting research in AI.  I enjoy tackling challenging problems and continuously expanding my skillset. I'm particularly interested in:

*   **Machine Learning:**  Clustering, Classification, Regression, Model Evaluation, Churn Prediction
*   **Deep Learning:** CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, Transfer Learning, LLMs
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Sentiment Analysis, Intent Recognition, Text Processing
*   **Software Development:**  Software Analysis, Design, and development, API design, scalable systems, database systems and systems engineering.

## Featured Projects

Here are some of my key projects, showcasing my skills and interests.  Click the links for more details and code!

*   **[Explicit Content Detection App](https://github.com/SHIXOOM/Help-Me):** (Jan 2025) A mobile application that leverages a PyTorch-based image classifier (using MobileNetV3) to detect explicit content.  Includes an Android app built with Kotlin that integrates with the model for real-time filtering.  *Technologies: PyTorch, Transfer Learning, Android, Kotlin, GitHub Copilot.*

*   **[EduBot - LLM-Powered Chatbot](https://github.com/muha-0/EduBot):** (Sept 2024) A chatbot designed for academic and self-improvement assistance. Utilizes Groq's API for fast LLM inference (LLaMA 3.3 70B) and includes a machine learning model (stacking) for predicting student exam scores (R¬≤ = 0.7).  Implements structured data extraction and intent recognition using LLMs. *Technologies: Python, Groq, LLMs, Azure, Scikit-learn, Stacking, Boosting.*

*   **[Medical Diagnosis Chatbot](https://github.com/SHIXOOM/Doctor-Diagnosis-ChatBot):** (April 2024) A chatbot demonstrating the integration of various technologies for medical diagnosis support.  Features an LSTM neural network for sentiment analysis (77% accuracy on 500K+ text data) built with Python and TensorFlow.  Includes a data layer built with Scala and Slick for database interaction (PostgreSQL) and uses Docker for containerization. Deployed using FastAPI and Railway. *Technologies: Scala, PostgreSQL, Docker, Functional Programming, TensorFlow, RNNs, FastAPI, Railway.*

* **Customer Retention Project (Attijariwafa Bank):** (Aug - Nov 2024) Led a data science project to improve customer retention and reduce churn. Involved data extraction, cleaning, engineering, and the development of both clustering and churn prediction models. Evaluated various algorithms including Logistic Regression, SGD, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and LSTMs. Presented findings to non-technical stakeholders. *This was a professional internship; a public repository may not be available.*

## Research

I'm also actively involved in research:

*   **[PAIR: A Novel Large Language Model-Guided Selection Strategy for Evolutionary Algorithms](https://github.com/SHIXOOM/PAIR) (Under Publication):**  Leveraged LLMs to significantly improve partner selection in evolutionary algorithms, achieving a 62% reduction in the optimality gap. Developed scalable and well-documented code.

*   **Time Series and Predictive Analysis of Egypt's Net Migration Patterns (Under Publication):** Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Egypt's net migration patterns using statistical and economic methods.

*   **MotionCaution: Smartphone Application for Securing the Motions of Real-Time Vehicles (Published in ICCCNet-2024):**  Developed a proof-of-concept application using Kotlin and Google Cloud Platform APIs, and contributed to the theoretical explanation of Decision Tree models in the paper.
