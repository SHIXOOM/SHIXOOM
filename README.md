## Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I am Shady, currently a sophomore at Egypt University of Informatics
I am currently persuing a career in AI/Data Science. I have done two research papers so far where I presented one of them in ICCCN 2024 UK Conference. I have also made some fun projects using Deep Learning, Databases, and different languages and programming paradigms for practicing and improving my skills


ðŸ”­ I am currently working on a Customer Retention project @ Attijariwafa Bank, developing a customer churn prediction model alongside a customer segmentation model. This project has completed one development cycle so far and thankfully it's taken seriously and will be deployed and used in the bank.
