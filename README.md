## Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I am Shady, a junior CS student at Egypt University of Informatics
I am currently persuing a career in AI/Data Science. I have done two research papers so far where I presented one of them (*MotionCaution*) in ICCCN 2024 UK Conference. I have also made some fun projects using Deep Learning, Databases, and different languages and programming paradigms for practicing and improving my skills

My main focus doing any project is not just improving my current set of skills, but mainly to face new challenges and push myself in new areas to further expand my knowledge, skills, and experience.
