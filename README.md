## Research

I'm also actively involved in research:

*   **[PAIR: A Novel Large Language Model-Guided Selection Strategy for Evolutionary Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03239) (Accepted at *International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems*):**  Leveraged LLMs to significantly improve partner selection in evolutionary algorithms, achieving a 62% reduction in the optimality gap. Developed scalable and well-documented code.

*   **Time Series and Predictive Analysis of Egypt's Net Migration Patterns (Under Publication):** Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Egypt's net migration patterns using statistical and economic methods.

*   **[MotionCaution: Smartphone Application for Securing the Motions of Real-Time Vehicles](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-96-6124-4_46) (Published in Springer LNNS as proceedings of ICCCNet-2024 conference):**  Developed a proof-of-concept application using Kotlin and Google Cloud Platform APIs, and contributed to the theoretical explanation of Decision Tree models in the paper.
